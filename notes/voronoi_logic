horizontal/vertical half edge
	exists: don't add anything
	else: node at 1/4 dist. along the HE
diagonal half edge:
	with upper-left nbr.
		no edge: only 1 point; where?
			quarter distances away if no gap
			#connection
		else: one or two points:
			up&left or neither hvHEs: figure 4
			else: figure 6
	...three symmetric cases
