horizontal/vertical half edge
	exists: don't add anything
	else: node at 1/4 dist. along the HE
diagonal half edge:
	with upper-left nbr.
		no edge: only 1 point; where?
			if upper and left are connected to each other:
				quarter distances away
			else:
				place it at upper-left corner of pixel
		else:
			(both self-up and self-left) or (neither):
				figure 4b
			else:
				figure 6
	...three symmetric cases
