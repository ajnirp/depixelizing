in smw_boo.png, the outline of the body has length 43 and there are 19 diagonals - curves heuristic
in 8x8.png, the top left pink pixel in the two diagonals is (7,10). There are 41 white pixels and 5 pink pixels, however, the white pixels are connected to the gray pixels which in turn are connected to the dark gray pixels, so effectively the size of the white connected component is 56 (64 total pixels - 5 pink pixels - 3 black pixels) - sparse heuristic
