*[what about a non-visible edge]
visible edges (where significantly different colors meet)
	connected sequences (that contain only valence-2 nodes)
		count only visible edges to determine valence of node
	converted into <quadratic> B-spline curves
		control points of B-splines initialized to node locations

if three splines end at single common node
	if "separated" cells have a YUV distance of at most 100/255
		categorize as shading edge; else contour edge
	if one shading edge and two contour edges
		connect the contour edges
if this heuristic does not resolve the situation
	connect the pair angle between edges closest to 180 degrees [Fig. 5B]

adjust endpoint of curve that ends at a T-junction to
lie on the curve that continues through the T-junction
